## About

guitos is a simple budgeting app that helps you figure out where your money went and plan your budget ahead of time.

It stores data in your browser's local storage ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)). Your private financial data doesn't leave your browser.

guitos was initially created to replace a spreadsheet and as an opportunity to learn React.

guitos is [portuguese slang](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/guito) for money/cash.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Any modern browser with javascript enabled.

### Installation

It's not necessary to install anything in order to use this app.

However, if you'd like to use it offline, follow the instructions for your device on:
[web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/progressive-web-apps/#desktop-and-laptops)

## Usage

### From scratch:

1. Visit [guitos.app](https://guitos.app)
2. Create a new budget and name it according to your preferred budget period
   - ideally in one of the following formats: `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-WN`
3. Input your revenue for the respective period (salary, sales, etc.)
4. Fill in the expenses (groceries, electricity, etc.)
5. Change the savings goal to your preference
6. Update the reserves field with the current value of your emergency fund / cash

### In case you have a backup/would like to import data from another source:

1. Visit [guitos.app](https://guitos.app)
2. Import data from single/multiple CSV files or a single JSON file.
   Make sure they follow the required structure:

### Keyboard shortcuts:

Keyboard shortcuts can be triggered when no input field is selected.

| Action               | Shortcut |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| Clone current budget | C        |
| Create new budget    | A        |
| Export data          | S        |
| Go to older budget   | PageDown |
| Go to newer budget   | PageUp   |

### CSV data model:

```csv
type,name,value
expense,rent,1000.00
expense,food,200.00
income,salary,2000.00
income,sale,100
goal,goal,10
reserves,reserves,0
```

- Note that the name of the CSV file is parsed as the name of the budget:

  2023-04.csv results in a budget with the name of "2023-04".

### JSON data model:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "035c2de4-00a4-403c-8f0e-f81339be9a4e",
    "name": "2023-03",
    "expenses": {
      "items": [{ "id": 1, "name": "expense1", "value": 10 }],
      "total": 10
    },
    "incomes": {
      "items": [{ "id": 2, "name": "income1", "value": 100 }],
      "total": 100
    },
    "stats": {
      "available": 0,
      "withGoal": 0,
      "saved": 0,
      "goal": "10",
      "reserves": "0"
    }
  }
]
```

- Note that the ID of each budget inside the JSON file should be a [v4 UUID](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>) as created by the `crypto.randomUUID()` [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID).

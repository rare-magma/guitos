## About

Guitos is a simple budgeting app that helps you figure out where your money went and plan your budget ahead of time.

It stores data in your browser's local storage ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)). Your private financial data doesn't leave your browser.

Guitos was initially created to replace a spreadsheet and as an opportunity to learn React.

Guitos is [portuguese slang](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/guito) for money/cash.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any modern browser with javascript enabled.

### Installation

It's not necessary to install anything in order to use this app.

However, if you'd like to use it offline, follow the instructions for your device on:
[web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/progressive-web-apps/#desktop-and-laptops)

## Usage

1. Visit [guitos.app](https://guitos.app)
2. Create a new budget and name it according to your preferred budget period (ideally `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-WN`)
3. Input your revenue for the period (salary, sales, etc.)
4. Fill in the expenses (groceries, electricity, etc.)
5. Change the savings goal to your preference
6. Update the reserves field with the current value of your emergency fund / cash

or

1. Visit [guitos.app](https://guitos.app)
2. Import previous data from single/multiple CSV files or a single JSON file.
   Make sure they follow the required structure:

### CSV data model:

```csv
type,name,value
expense,rent,1000.00
expense,food,200.00
income,salary,2000.00
income,sale,100
goal,goal,10
reserves,reserves,0
```

- Note that the name of the csv file is parsed as the name of the budget:

  2023-04.csv results in a budget with the name of "2023-04".

### JSON data model:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "035c2de4-00a4-403c-8f0e-f81339be9a4e",
    "name": "2023-03",
    "expenses": {
      "items": [{ "id": 1, "name": "expense1", "value": 10 }],
